# [05] Tooling Week: Day 2 - Git

## Talk: Why do we need remote repos

- [ ] Key reasons: collaboration, deployments and backups
- [ ] Basic remote workflow
- [ ] Deploying code / ways of working remotely (with servers)
	- on server
	- FTP
	- Git
- [ ] Git repo hosts
- [ ] Git != GitHub


## Demo: setting up, linking remote

- [ ] setup GitHub
- [ ] linking remote - `git remote add origin {"Clone with SSH" URL from GitHub}`
- [ ] explain `origin`
- [ ] `git fetch`
- [ ] pushing there - `git push -u origin master`
- [ ] show code and history
- [ ] further changes only need `git push`


## Talk: Pushing and pulling branches to remote
- [ ] Why push branches
- [ ] Basic commands of creating and pushing branches
- [ ] Pull requests and merge conflicts
 
## Demo: Feature branches & Pull Requests

- [ ] branching with remote, pushing to remote

	`git checkout master`

	`git branch new-branch`

	`git checkout new-branch`

	[do work and stage files]

	`git commit -m "commit message"`

	`git push origin new-branch`

- [ ] creating a pull request and resolving it

## Exercises

- [02-pull-requests.md](../challenges/02/02-pull-requests.md)


## Talk: Existing repos

- `git clone`
- push rejections
- merge conflicts

## Demo 

- `git clone`
- push rejections
- merge conflicts



- [03-collaboration-on-master.md](../challenges/02/03-collaboration-on-master.md)

## Talk: doing better with workflows

- Working with feature branches and pull requests
- Typical roles: Team lead, tech lead, dev lead
- Role of QA: who does review of pull requests
- Role of peer review in teams

## Exercises

- [04-team-pull-requests.md](../challenges/02/04-team-pull-requests.md)
- [05-issues.md](../challenges/02/05-issues.md)

## Talk: workflows

- justifcation: who has to deal with conflicts
- centralised
- feature branch
- Gitflow
    - `develop`: most work done here
    - `feature` branches: branch from and back into `develop`
    - `release` branches: for merging `develop` into `master`
    - `hotfix` branches: branch from `master`, merges back into `master` and `develop`
    - `master`: fully-working, ready to be used
    - keeps a clear line between in progress (`develop`) and done (`master`)
    - `master` => production, `develop` => staging
    - not appropriate for all projects (e.g. deploy early and often)
- forking

## Demo: GitHub Pages

- [ ] free project hosting
- [ ] show turning it on
- [ ] show site
