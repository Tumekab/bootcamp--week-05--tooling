# [05] Tooling Week: Day 2 - Git


## Talk: file lifesycle & staging
- [ ] role and usage of `.gitignore`

## Talk: Branches

- [ ] basic usage and visualisation

### Demo

- [ ] master as default branch (synonymous with "production") `git branch -a`
- [ ] create branch `git branch {branch-name}`
- [ ] checkout branch `git checkoout {branch-name}`
- [ ] see branches `git branch -a`
- [ ] do work and commit 
- [ ] switching branches `git checkout master`
- [ ] merge branch `git merge {branch-name}`
- [ ] delete branch `git branch -D {branch-name}`

### Exercise

- [01-branches.md](../challenges/02/01-branches.md)


## Talk: Why do we need remote repos

- [ ] Key reasons: collaboration, deployments and backups
- [ ] Basic remote workflow
- [ ] Git repo hosts
- [ ] Git != GitHub
- [ ] New project process

## Demo: setting up, linking remote

- [ ] setup GitHub
- [ ] linking remote - `git remote add origin {"Clone with SSH" URL from GitHub}`
- [ ] explain `origin`
- [ ] `git fetch`
- [ ] pushing there - `git push -u origin master`
- [ ] show code and history in github
- [ ] further changes only need `git push`
- [ ] show code and history in github


## Talk: Pushing and pulling branches to remote

- [ ] Why push branches
- [ ] Basic commands of creating and pushing branches


## Demo: Create branch locally and push it

- [ ] `git checkout master`
- [ ] `git branch new-branch`
- [ ] `git checkout new-branch`
- [ ] [do work and stage files]
- [ ] `git commit -m "commit message"`
- [ ] `git push origin new-branch`
- [ ] Show output in terminal - check work is in remote repo
- [ ] [do work and stage files]
- [ ] `git push` 
- [ ] Explain why its the shorter version
- [ ] Show output in terminal - check work is in remote repo

- [03-push-branches.md](../challenges/02/03-push-branches.md)


## Talk: Pull requests and merge conflicts
- [ ] Pull requests
- [ ] Resolving pull requests with no conflicts
 

## Demo: Pull Requests

- [ ] create a pull request inside github
- [ ] review pull request and look at conflicts
- [ ] open the view command line instructions, talk through steps
- [ ] NB `git merge --no-ff` will ensure a new commit is made the for the merg
- [ ] resolve it - should be conflict free at this point

## Exercise

Practising all the different parts

- [04-pull-requests.md](../challenges/02/04-pull-requests.md)


## Talk: Existing repos

- `git clone`


## Demo 

- `git clone https://github.com/develop-me/git-simple`
- Observe the new directory being created and it's name
- 'git clone https://github.com/develop-me/git-simple piglet`
- Observe new directory name


## Talk: Existing repos

- push rejections
- merge conflicts


## Demo 

Push rejection

- [ ] Get latest version of master branch and check it out
- [ ] Make some changes on the master branch, save and commit - DO NOT PUSH
- [ ] Open up GitHub and edit a file to ensure there will be a conflict - simulates someone editing a file at the same time as you
- [ ] Try and push, you get a push rejection.

Merge conflict

- [ ] Run `git pull` to get the changed code locally
- [ ] Should get a merge conflict
- [ ] Resolve it in the code editor.
- [ ] Save and `git push`
