\section{Why use gulp?}

gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming taks in your development and build workflow.
\\

It's not the only toolkit available. There's also \href{https://webpack.js.org/}{Webpack}, \href{https://gruntjs.com/}{Grunt}, \href{https://yarnpkg.com/}{Yarn} and a whole heap more.
\\

We teach gulp because it is fairly quick to learn (some might say, we'll take your judgement on that though!), commonly used and pretty quick to run tasks with.
\\

\subsection{What tasks would we like to automate?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Compiling SASS to CSS
	\item Minifying CSS and JS files
	\item Refreshing your browser when you save a file in your project directory
	\item Convert spaces to tabs or vice versa
	\item Transpiling ES6 to ES5 code
\end{itemize}


\section{gulp basics}

Gulp uses JavaScript and is based on node.js.
\\

It \textbf{reads files as streams} and \textbf{pipes the streams} to different tasks.
\\

Those tasks will then modify the files, or build news ones depending on the tasks defined.
