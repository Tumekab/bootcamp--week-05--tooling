# Improving workflow with pull requests

Let's improve our workflow with Pull Requests.

1) Work with feature branches locally

1) Push your branch up to GitHub

1) Then create a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/develop-me/git-simple/branches) and assign to another team member as a *Reviewer*

1) Review a merge request that someone else has sent you.

*Note: the project repository is available on GitHub here: [https://github.com/develop-me/git-simple](https://github.com/develop-me/git-simple)*

*If you need a reminder of the order of operations, refer to [02-pull-requests.md](02-pull-requests.md) challenge.*

**Add an emoji to slack once you have sent someone a pull request and dealt with one sent to you**	

## Advanced challenge

These are optional challenges you can do if you finish quickly.
