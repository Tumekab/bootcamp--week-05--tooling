# Setting up to work with a remote repository

*Note: the project repository is available on GitHub here: [https://github.com/develop-me/git-simple](https://github.com/develop-me/git-simple)*

1) **Copy the existing repo**

   Use `git clone` to create a new project directory on your machine
   The remote URL is `git@github.com:develop-me/git-simple.git`

1) **Do work**

   Make some changes to the site & preview changes in browser

   Commit them

1) **Put your changes on the repo**

   Now start to use `git push` and `git pull`.

   If you get a push rejection then `git pull` first then `git push`

   If you get a conflict then resolve that, commit and push again

### The aim of this exercise is to show you how a few things:

- How push rejections and merge conflicts arise 
- How utterly mad it is having a team of people working on the master branch at the same time
