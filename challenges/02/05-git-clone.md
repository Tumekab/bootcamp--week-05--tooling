# Setting up to work with a remote repository

*Note: the project repository is available on GitHub here: [https://github.com/develop-me/git-simple](https://github.com/develop-me/git-simple)*

1) **Decide where you want to place the new repo in your file structure**

   In your terminal navigate to the parent directory of where you want your new directory to be

   Eg
   You have a directory called 'Tooling week' 
   You want your new repo to be inside 'Tooling week'
   You just navigate to the 'Tooling week' directory
   `cd /Users/hannah/Dropbox/Apps/local/tooling-week`

1) **Run git clone**

   Use `git clone git@github.com:develop-me/git-simple.git` 
   This creates a new project directory on your machine and places the content of the remote repo inside it
