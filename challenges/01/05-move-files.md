# Moving/renaming files

This is an advanced task - if you have questions or help please ask your instructor or TA for help outside of the main lectures. The main class will not wait whilst you attempt these.

1) **Use `git mv {old-path} {new-path}` to relocate a file**
	This stages that change at the same time.
	
	Now create a commit of that change.
1) **Move a file using Finder/Explorer**
	Move a file into a new sub-folder.
	
	Use `git status` to see what Git thinks just happened.

	Stage this change and commit this change to your project.
1) **Rename a file**
	Use `git status` again to see what Git thinks has just happened.
	
	Commit the change.
