# Level 4: Send your GitHub username to us

### Doing this at the start of the course

If you are doing this right at the start of the course your GitHub username will be noted when going through the set-up process with you.


### Doing this just ahead of week 5
We've recently changed the set-up process so chances are you already did all of this right at the beginning of the course. So you don't need to send us your GitHub name again.

However, if you have changed your GitHub name for any reason or just want to be sure you can send it to Hannah on Slack.
