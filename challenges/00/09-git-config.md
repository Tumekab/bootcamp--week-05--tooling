# Bonus Level: Configure Some Git Settings

## Configure Git to use VS Code as its editor

### Mac

In VS Code: `shift + ⌘ + P`

Type or paste `> Shell Command: Install 'Code' command in path` hit `[Enter]`

### Windows

In VS Code: `shift + ctrl + P`

Type or paste `> Shell Command: Install 'Code' command in path` hit `[Enter]`

Make sure you selected Add to PATH during the installation.

### All systems

From the command line, run

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

## So that Git knows who your commits are made by

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

## So that Git knows which branch on the remote to push to

```bash
git config --global push.default matching
```

## So that Git ignores unnecessary files

Computers files in our folders sometimes that we don't need to track in our projects.

### Mac

We want to ignore `.DS_Store` files. These files are made by the Mac filesystem to store folder attributes, and are not part of our projects.

```bash
echo ".DS_Store" >> ~/.gitignore_global
echo "*.code-workspace" >> ~/.gitignore_global
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

### Windows

In Ubuntu/WSL:

```bash
echo "Thumbs.db" >> ~/.gitignore_global
echo "*.code-workspace" >> ~/.gitignore_global
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```
