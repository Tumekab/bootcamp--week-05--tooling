# Quiz

## Advice

This is an open book quiz. That means it's ok to:

- Draw from (or add) to your own notes.
- Use the slides or notes pdf.
- Look up answers on google.
- Setup your own test project directory to match the question setup.

It's not ok to do this as a team or to share answers with each other.

Send your answers to your instructor in [markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and you will get a score and feedback on how you did.

## 1. Getting setup with Git

What does this command do?

`git remote add origin git@github.com:develop-me/drupal1.git`

Think about what each of these parts tells us:

a) `git remote add origin`

b) `git@github.com`

c) `develop-me`

d) `drupal1.git`


## 2. Committing files

Here is the state of our project directory after running `git status`:

```bash
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   hello.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	images/
	index.html
```

What commands would I run to first commit the `images` folder and `index.html` with message `"Apple"` and then, on the next commit, have `hello.html` with message `"Banana"`?

## 3. Reading Git messages: Oh noes #1

```bash
To github.com:develop-me/git-simple.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:develop-me/git-simple.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

a) What command have I just run?

b) What has gone wrong?

c) What should I do next?

## 4. Reading Git messages: Oh noes #2

```bash
remote: Enumerating objects: 38, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (38/38), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (16/16), done.
remote: Total 53 (delta 26), reused 31 (delta 22), pack-reused 15
Unpacking objects: 100% (53/53), done.

```

a) What command have I just run?

b) What has gone wrong?

c) What should I do next?

## 5. Reading Git messages: Oh noes #3

a) What command have I just run?

b) What has gone wrong?

c) What should I do next?

```bash
remote: Enumerating objects: 9, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (8/8), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 5 (delta 3), reused 5 (delta 3), pack-reused 0

Auto-merging index.html
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
## 6. Burn it all!

How do you 'throw away' all work since last commit, and revert to how the files were at that moment?

*Note: think about using [ohshitgit.com](https://ohshitgit.com/) to help you recover from Git mistakes.*

## 7. (Sort of) Burn it all!

How do you 'throw away' the last commit `bbb123`, going back to the commit before last `aaa123`, but keep the files as they are (i.e. the changes as they are respresentated in commit `bbb123`), to not lose that work.

## 8. Ignore it all!

Create a `.gitignore` file that will cause Git to only track `hello.html` in my folder:

## 9. Describe the process

You're working in a team that uses the gitflow workflow.

Document the steps, and git commands, from starting a new piece of work on a new feature branch, to submitting it as a pull request like this:

```bash
git command1
git command2
git command3
...
```

## 10. npm & gulp

We're starting working on a new project and want to bring in some of our favourite gulp workflow from a previous project.

What steps should we take and what commands will we need to run?

*Note: this idea is to save work starting a new project by re-using a setup you've made before*

## 11. Git, npm & gulp

Our fresh project needs a `.gitignore` file, what should its contents be?

## 12. Gulp and git

Our project uses gulp tasks to compile our source sass files into a `styles.min.css` file.

In merging another developer's work we end up with these files having Git conflicts, what should we do to resolve each?:

```bash
/scss/_headings.scss
/css/styles.min.css # produced by a gulp task
about.html
```
